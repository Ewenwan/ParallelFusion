\subsection{Swarm Fusion optical flow}

We use Swarm fusion to solve an optical flow problem, where a baseline
is a FM-based algorithm by Lempitsky et al.~\cite{viktor_optical_flow}.
Although their paper did not consider parallel implementation, it is
straightfoward to apply the concept of parallel alpha-expansion and
construct a ``parallel fusion move'' method, where multiple threads
repeat fusing two solutions via QPBO. This time, we will compare it with
our full swarm fusion model (bottom right example in
Fig.~\ref{fig:model}).
