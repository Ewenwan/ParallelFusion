\section{Swarm Fusion implementations}
We now explain detailed implementation of the Swarm Fusion method for
three problems in Computer Vision.

\subsection{Swarm Fusion stereo}
We start with a relatively ``easy'' problem, a depthmap stereo problem
with unary and submodular pairwise terms. Parallel
alpha-expansion~\cite{delong} or hierarchical fusion~\cite{delong,olga}
with Graph-cuts (when submodular) or QPBO (when non-submodular) have
been the most effective techniques.
%
To make the comparison simple, we restrict our proposal generation to be
constant-label proposals, and limit to binary fusion so that Swarm
Fusion will also use either Graph-cuts or QPBO for the core
optimization. The main difference is that SF exchanges solutions among
threads throughout the process.

We use Middlebury stereo datasets for the experiments. Unary terms are
computed as the average Normalized Cross Correlation score between the
reference image and all the others inside a $7\times 7$ pixels
window. Pairwise terms are simple Pottz model. We multiply \yasu{X
value?} to the unary term to define the total energy.
