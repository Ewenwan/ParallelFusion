\section{Swarm Fusion instantiation}
We compare SF against competing approaches over three problems in
Computer Vision. SF framework has high degrees of freedom and the
challenge is to properly quantity the contributions of various
algorithmic aspects. For this purpose, we have used the three SF
architectures illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:model}. For some problems, we
have further limited the capabilities of SF on purpose, to enable
effective and fair comparative evaluations. We now explain the details
of the three problems.

% We pick three representative problems in Computer Vision to evaluate the
% effectiveness of the Fusion swarm methods against existing methods. We

 problem, the input is an RGBD image, and the output is multiple layeres

\subsection{Swarm Fusion stereo}
We start with a simple depthmap stereo problem with standard unary and
pairwise terms. We employ submodular pairwise terms to make this stereo
represent relatively ``easy'' MRF inference problems.
%
Unary terms are computed as the average Normalized Cross Correlation
score between the reference image and the others inside a $7\times 7$
pixels window. Pairwise terms are simple Pottz model. The total energy
is defined by the sum of the two, while scaling the pairwise term by a
factor of \yasu{X value}.
%
We use Middlebury stereo datasets for the experiments.

\mysubsubsection{Competing methods}

\noindent The sophistication of photometric consistency
function~\cite{mvs_furukawa_survey} makes unary terms dominant in most
stereo problems.  Our experiments have also supported this, where the
fusion method (i.e., the use of proposal generation) rather makes it slow
due to the overhead.  Therefore, we pick parallel
alpha-expansion~\cite{delong} and hierarchical fusion~\cite{delong,olga}
with graph-cuts optimization as the competing methods.

\mysubsubsection{Swarm fusion architectures}

\noindent The three swarm architectures in Fig.~\ref{fig:model} have
been evaluated: SFWSS (SF without solution sharing), SFWMF (SF without
multi-way fusion), and the standard SF.
%
For SFWSS, we have chosen $\alpha=2$ ($\beta=0$). For SFWMF, each thread
iterates the step of ($\alpha=1, \beta=0$) or ($\alpha=0, \beta=1$) so
that it can take a solution proposal in one step and a neighboring
solution in the next. For the standard SF, we have used ($\alpha=1, \beta=1$).
%
%
%
%
To make the comparison simple, we restrict our proposal
generation to be constant-label proposals. Graph-cuts is used in fusing
a constant-label proposal as the energy is submodular. QPBO is used in
fusing a different solution from another thread as the energy is
non-submodular.
%
% Due to the lack of multi-way fusion, the swarm fusion architecture for
% the stereo problem is represented by the middle example at the bottom of
% Fig.~\ref{fig:model}.
