\section{Experimental results} \label{section:results}
We have implemented the algorithms in C++ and conducted the experiments
on Linux PCs with Intel Core i7 processor with 4 cores, enabling 8 threads
with the hyper threading technology. We have used the Graph-cuts
optimization code written by Veksler, using the libraries provided by
Boykov and Kolmogorov~\cite{middle_bury,2,3,4_below}.

We have used the QPBO and TRW-S implementations by
Kolmogorov~\cite{msr_link?,trw_link}.
