\section{Experimental results}
\label{section:results}
We have implemented the algorithms with multithreading supporting from
C++ 11 and conducted the experiments on Linux PCs with Intel Core i7
4790 processor with 4 cores, enabling 8 threads with the hyper
threading technology. We have used the Graph-cuts optimization code
written by Veksler, using the libraries provided by Boykov and
Kolmogorov~\cite{middlebury_mrf,alpha_expansion,what_energy_can_be_min_by_gc, mrf_experimental}.

We have used the QPBO and TRW-S implementations by
Kolmogorov~\cite{QPBO, TRW-S_implementation}.
