\section{Experimental results}
\label{section:results} We have implemented the algorithms with
multi-threading support from C++ 11, and conducted the experiments on
Linux PCs with Intel Core i7 4790 processor with 4 cores. We have used
the Graph-cuts optimization code written by Veksler, using the libraries
provided by Boykov and
Kolmogorov~\cite{middlebury_mrf,alpha_expansion,what_energy_can_be_min_by_gc,mrf_experimental}.

We have used the QPBO and TRW-S implementations by
Kolmogorov~\cite{QPBO, TRW-S}. We have used 4 threads
for experiments unless indicated. We now look at our experimental
results for the three problems.



% To evaluate the effectness of different parallel structures, we plot
% the energy minimization process against time. We define the energy of
% a parallel optimization system at a certain time as the minimum energy
% of all threads at that time.

%As shown in the above problem settings, the solution sharing and
%multi-way fusion enabled by our uniform framework play a key role for
%improving performance in different problem settings.
