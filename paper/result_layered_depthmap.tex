\mysubsubsection{Layered depthmap estimation}

\noindent We have used ``ours\_1'' data in~\cite{layered_depthmap} for
the experiments. Figure~\ref{fig:layered_depthmap_convergence} shows
that Fusion Move, Parallel Fusion Move and SF-MF all got stuck in local
minima, which is due to the lack of multi-way fusion.  Layered depthmap
estimation is a challenging problem with very large solution space. The
binary fusion of solution proposals is too restrictive to make any
improvements.  This coincides with the observation in
\cite{layered_depthmap} that binary fusion of proposal solutions is not
as powerful as their subspace fusion which is a special form of
multi-way fusion here. Lastly, solution sharing also plays an important
role for this challenging problem for exactly the same reason, as SF
performs much better than SF-SS.

%From the plot, we can see that, Fusion Move, Parallel Fusion Move, and
%SF-MF all stalk at a high energy state.
To further study the effects of multi-way fusion, we have varied the
value of $\alpha$ in controlling the number of solution proposals to be
fused in SF-SS model (See
Fig.~\ref{fig:layered_depthmap_by_alpha}). Note that we have used SF-SS
instead of SS to disable solution sharing and better observe the effects
of multi-way fusion.

It is interesting to see that more multi-way fusion takes longer to
converge, but finds a lower energy state at the end.
%We can see that as the number of
%ways to fuse becomes larger, each fusion step takes longer time, but the
%chance of finding a lower energy state increases.
